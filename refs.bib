  abstract = "UNLABELLED: MSnbase is an R/Bioconductor package for the analysis
              of quantitative proteomics experiments that use isobaric tagging.
              It provides an exploratory data analysis framework for
              reproducible research, allowing raw data import, quality control,
              visualization, data processing and quantitation. MSnbase allows
              direct integration of quantitative proteomics data with
              additional facilities for statistical analysis provided by the
              Bioconductor project. AVAILABILITY: MSnbase is implemented in R
              (version $\geq$ 2.13.0) and available at the Bioconductor web
              site (http://www.bioconductor.org/). Vignettes outlining typical
              workflows, input/output capabilities and detailing underlying
              infrastructure are included in the package.",
